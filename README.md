## AnagramChecker

# Instructions
Open the source code of Main.java and AnagramChecker.java within IntelliJ IDEA and execute the program within Main.java with the hard-coded strings given within the Main method. Dependencies required: JUnit.

# Highlights
AnagramChecker.java contains all logic behind the execution of the program. Tests are covered in AppTest.java

# Improvements
A useful feature to include would be a user input for both strings so that anyone using the program can control the strings that are checked for an anagram.
